# Advent of Cyber 2025

This code repo is my solution to the
[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about)

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -- --day=1 --part=2 --sample=0 
```

## Known Issues

- `data` folder is missing. This is to comply with the official Advent of Code
policy. Copying the input is not allowed. The program expects the input
in the form `/data/day{1-12}/sample{X}.txt`. `X` maps to the value provided in
`--sample` option while running the program.
